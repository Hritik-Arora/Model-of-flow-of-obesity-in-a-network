# Model-of-flow-of-obesity-in-a-network

Christakis and Fowler published a research paper on the effect of social networks on health- related issues. In this project, we will be
focusing on the 'obesity problem'. They found that obese and non- obese people clustered in the network in a fashion consistent with 
homophily. This project is a model of the same and it starts with a random network of 100 people.
